Rhine is a simple, mobile-friendly, HTML5-based music game.

THIS IS A PREVIEW OF THE GAME! THE GAME WILL BE OUT SOON!

The main feature is the level editor.

Please note that due to some limitations with scratch, songs over 175 bpm are sometimes timed weirdly on quarter notes.

If you find any weird bugs or glitches, please let me know. This is very experimental and I want to make it as polished as possible.

Disclaimer: I do not own any of the songs used, the names and creators of the songs are listed.
